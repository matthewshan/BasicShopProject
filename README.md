The program uses html, css, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. My intend was to learn thes language and gain proficiency on the langauges.

I have not worked on this since the mid summer 2017, however, I wish to continue this project in the near future.

DISCLAIMER:
This is an INCOMPLETE web app that I began developing in my senior year of HIGH SCHOOL (Early 2017). This was intended for me as a learning experience.
