Objective: The program uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. My intent was to learn or gain proficiency on language.

This is a web app that I began developing in my senior year of HIGH SCHOOL (Early 2017). This was intended for me as a learning experience as listed above. Backend web development is something I find interest in.
